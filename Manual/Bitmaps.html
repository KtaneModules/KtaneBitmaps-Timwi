            <h2>On the Subject of Bitmaps</h2>
            <p class="flavour-text">Over 18 quintillion combinations, only some of them actually matter.

            <ul>
                <li>The module displays a bitmap of 64 pixels divided into four “quadrants”. Each pixel is
                    bright (which we call “white” although it may be colored) or dark (“black”).
                <li>There are 4 buttons underneath, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
                <li>In the following table, start at the rule whose number equals the last digit of the serial number.
                <li>Keep going through the rules (wrapping around if necessary) until you encounter a condition that applies.
                <li>Calculate the answer for the applicable rule. Repeatedly add or subtract 4 until the answer is between
                    1 and 4 and press the corresponding button to disarm the module.
            </ul>
